This is the source code of the l1 and l2 loss based ADMM solutions in our IEEE GRSL paper:

Xiong, ``Denoising of bistatic ranges for elliptic positioning,'' IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett., vol. 20, pp. 1--3, 2023, Art. no. 3500503.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
